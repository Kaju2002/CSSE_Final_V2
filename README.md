1. Combine All Booking Steps into a Single “Smart Stepper Wizard”

Current: Each booking stage (hospital → service → doctor → slot → confirm) is a separate page.
Proposed: Introduce a horizontal stepper panel (like progress bar + step navigation) visible at all times.
Reason: Improves orientation — users can jump between steps easily instead of using “Back.”
UI Example:
A persistent step tracker at the top:
[Hospital] → [Department] → [Doctor] → [Slot] → [Confirmation]

💬 2. Add “Smart Chat / AI Assistant” Sidebar

Current: Only manual navigation.
Proposed: Add a small AI or chatbot icon that can guide users — e.g., “Find the nearest cardiologist available today.”
Reason: Improves accessibility, aligns with “Smart Healthcare” system theme.
Bonus: Connect this to your project’s chatbot component for future integration.

🗓️ 3. Integrate Calendar Sync & Reminder

Current: Confirmation screen shows QR code only.
Proposed: Add “Add to Calendar” and “Set Reminder” buttons on the confirmation page.
Reason: Prevents missed appointments, adds real-world practicality.
Visual: Two icons under the QR code – 🗓 “Add to Google Calendar” and 🔔 “Remind me 1 hour before.”

💳 4. Enhance Payment with “Estimated Insurance Coverage”

Current: Shows basic payment methods.
Proposed: Add a section showing “Estimated Insurance Coverage / Discount” or “Government Service Coverage.”
Reason: Gives transparency and aligns with public–private hospital mix in Sri Lanka.
Visual: A small card above the payment options saying “Insurance covers 80% of your selected service.”

📱 5. Add Mobile-First Responsiveness (Collapsible Sidebar)

Current: Side navigation fixed on desktop-style layout.
Proposed: On mobile, collapse sidebar into a bottom navigation bar (🏥 Appointments, 📋 Records, ⚙️ Settings).
Reason: Makes app truly accessible for patients on mobile devices.

🔔 6. Add Appointment Follow-Up & Feedback Screen

Current: Ends at confirmation page.
Proposed: After appointment date passes, system prompts a feedback or rebooking page.
Reason: Supports continuous engagement and quality improvement metrics for the healthcare system.
