# Registration Flow Update - API Integration Complete ✅

## Overview

The registration flow has been updated to match the new Hospital Patient Registration API specification. The key change is that **user accounts are now created at the END of the registration process** instead of at the beginning.

## Previous Flow (OLD) ❌

1. **Step 1**: Collect personal info + email/password → Create user account immediately
2. **Step 2**: Upload documents (optional)
3. **Step 3**: Medical information (optional)
4. **Step 4**: Communication preferences + password confirmation
5. **Step 5**: Complete registration

**Problem**: User account was created before collecting all information, which could lead to incomplete registrations.

## New Flow (CURRENT) ✅

1. **Step 1**: Start registration → Get `registrationId` + Collect personal info (NO email/password)
2. **Step 2**: Upload documents (OPTIONAL - can skip)
3. **Step 3**: Medical information (OPTIONAL - can skip)
4. **Step 4**: Communication preferences + **Create account credentials** (email/password collected here)
5. **Step 5**: Complete registration → Creates user account + patient record + returns JWT token
6. **Step 6**: Success page with MRN and digital health card

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: This update changes the registration flow significantly:

1. **Email/password moved from Step 1 to Step 4**
   - Old code expecting email in Step 1 will fail
   - Update any analytics or tracking that references Step 1 email

2. **User account created at END, not beginning**
   - Registration sessions are now anonymous until completion
   - No user ID exists until `/api/registration/complete` is called

3. **Token handling updated**
   - All wizard endpoints NO LONGER require authentication
   - Token is only received after `/api/registration/complete`
