# 📅 Staff Scheduling System - Complete Integration Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. API Integration Layer** (`src/lib/utils/adminApi.ts`)

Added comprehensive Staff Scheduling API functions:

#### **New API Types**
```typescript
export type ApiAllocation = {
  departmentId: string;
  date: string;
  hour: string;
  requiredCount: number;
  staffIds: string[];
  notes?: string;
};

export type ApiSchedule = {
  _id: string;
  hospitalId: string | { _id: string; name: string };
  tz: string;
  dateRange: { from: string; to: string };
  allocations: ApiAllocation[];
  status: 'draft' | 'published';
  publishedAt?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

#### **New API Functions**

### **3. Enhanced Reports Page** (`src/Pages/Admin/Reports.tsx`)

#### **New "Schedule" Button**

Added staffing suggestion generator in the Reports page.

**Functionality:**
1. Click "Schedule" button (next to Download CSV)
2. Fetches staffing suggestions based on current report filters
3. Opens modal with AI-generated recommendations
4. Table shows:
   - Date
   - Department
   - Hour of day
   - Visit count
   - Average wait time
   - **Required staff count** (highlighted in blue badges)

**Integration:**
- Uses same date range and hospital as current report
- Calls `POST /api/schedules/suggestions`
- Strategy parameters:
  ```typescript
  {
    targetAvgWaitSeconds: 1800, // 30 minutes
    maxPatientsPerStaffPerHour: 6,
    hoursOfOperation: ['08:00', '09:00', ..., '17:00']

  icon: <CalendarIcon />
}
```

#### **`App.tsx`**
Added new route:
```tsx
<Route path="/admin/staff-scheduling" element={<StaffScheduling />} />
```

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

### **API Endpoints Needed**

Your backend must implement these endpoints:

#### **1. List Schedules**
```
GET /api/schedules/staff-allocations
Query params: hospitalId, from, to, page, limit
Response: {
  success: true,
  data: {
    items: ApiSchedule[],
    pagination: { total, page, limit, pages }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Create Schedule**
```
POST /api/schedules/staff-allocations
Body: {
  hospitalId: string,
  tz: string,
  dateRange: { from, to },
  allocations: ApiAllocation[]
}
Response: { success: true, data: { schedule: ApiSchedule } }
```

#### **3. Update Schedule**
```
PUT /api/schedules/staff-allocations/:id
Body: Partial<schedule>
Response: { success: true, data: { schedule: ApiSchedule } }
```

#### **4. Publish Schedule**
```
POST /api/schedules/staff-allocations/:id/publish
Response: {
  success: true,
  data: { notificationsSent: number }
}
```
**Important:** This endpoint should:
- Update schedule status to 'published'
- Set publishedAt timestamp
- Send email notifications to all assigned staff
- Return count of emails sent

#### **5. Delete Schedule**
```
DELETE /api/schedules/staff-allocations/:id
Response: { success: true, message: string }
```
**Important:** Should only allow deleting draft schedules

#### **6. Get Schedule by ID**
```
GET /api/schedules/staff-allocations/:id
Response: { success: true, data: { schedule: ApiSchedule } }
```

#### **7. Staffing Suggestions**
```
POST /api/schedules/suggestions
Body: {
  from: string,
  to: string,
  aggregate: string,
  hospitalId: string,
  departmentIds?: string[],
  strategy: {
    targetAvgWaitSeconds: number,
    maxPatientsPerStaffPerHour: number,
    hoursOfOperation: string[]
  }
}
Response: {
  success: true,
  data: {
    suggestions: [{
      date: string,
      departmentId: string,
      departmentName: string,
      hour: string,
      visits: number,
      avgWaitSeconds: number,
      requiredStaff: number
    }]
  }
}
```

**Algorithm Suggestion:**
```
requiredStaff = Math.ceil(visits / maxPatientsPerStaffPerHour)
// Only suggest for hours with high wait times or high visit counts
```

### **Creating a Schedule (Manual - Future Feature)**
```
User Input → Create Modal → API Call → Database
→ Success → Reload List → Show Success Message
```

### **Creating a Schedule (From Suggestions)**
```
Reports Data → Generate Suggestions → User Reviews
→ User Approves → Create Schedule API → Database
→ Draft Schedule Created → User Can Edit/Publish
```

### **Publishing a Schedule**
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### **Color Coding**
- 🟢 **Green badges**: Published schedules
- 🟡 **Yellow badges**: Draft schedules
- 🔵 **Blue badges**: Allocation counts, required staff

### **Smart Displays**
- Staff IDs automatically converted to names
- Department IDs automatically converted to names
- Hospital IDs automatically converted to names (with API populated data)
- Dates formatted with `toLocaleDateString()`
- Timezone displayed for each schedule

### **User Feedback**

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Authorization**
- All API calls include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- Token retrieved from `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
- Backend should verify admin role for these endpoints

### **Data Validation**
- Schedule dates validated on backend
- Staff IDs must exist in staff collection
- Department IDs must exist in departments collection
- Hospital IDs must exist in hospitals collection
- Can only delete draft schedules
- Can only publish draft schedules (not already published)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Error: "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<'"**

**Cause:** The API endpoint doesn't exist or returns HTML error page instead of JSON.

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend has `/api/schedules/staff-allocations` endpoint
2. Check backend is running
3. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` is correct
4. Check browser console Network tab for actual response
5. Verify authentication token is valid

### **Error: "Failed to load schedules: 404"**

**Cause:** Backend endpoint not implemented.

**Solution:** Implement the required backend endpoints (see Backend Requirements section)

### **Staff Names Show as "Unknown"**

**Cause:** Staff IDs in allocations don't match staff records.

**Solution:**
1. Verify staff records exist in database
2. Check staff IDs in allocations are correct
3. Ensure staff data is fetched successfully (`fetchAllStaff`)

### **Cannot Delete Published Schedules**

**Expected behavior:** Published schedules should not be deletable. Only draft schedules can be deleted.

**Reason:** Once staff are notified, the schedule becomes immutable to prevent confusion.

## 📝 Code Examples

### **Creating a Schedule (Future Implementation)**

```typescript
const handleCreateSchedule = async () => {
  try {
    setSaving(true)
    const newSchedule = await createStaffSchedule({
      hospitalId: selectedHospital,
      tz: 'Asia/Colombo',
      dateRange: {
        from: '2025-11-01',
        to: '2025-11-30'
      },
      allocations: [
        {
          departmentId: '68f7e996d1d6afb935c7e0f8',
          date: '2025-11-01',
          hour: '08:00',
          requiredCount: 4,
          staffIds: ['staff-id-1', 'staff-id-2'],
          notes: 'Morning shift'
        }
      ]
    })
    
    await loadData()
    setShowCreateModal(false)
    alert('Schedule created successfully!')
  } catch (err) {
    alert(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to create schedule')
  } finally {
    setSaving(false)
  }
}
```

### **Converting Suggestions to Schedule**

```typescript
const handleCreateFromSuggestions = async (suggestions: any[]) => {
  const allocations = suggestions.map(s => ({
    departmentId: s.departmentId,
    date: s.date,
    hour: s.hour,
    requiredCount: s.requiredStaff,
    staffIds: [], // Admin will assign staff later
    notes: `Auto-generated: ${s.visits} expected visits`
  }))
  
  await createStaffSchedule({
    hospitalId: currentHospitalId,
    tz: 'Asia/Colombo',
    dateRange: { from: dateFrom, to: dateTo },
    allocations
  })
}
```
